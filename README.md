This dataset, titled "US Accidents (2016 - 2019)", was collected in real-time through various traffic-related APIs and comprises over 1.1 million accident records across the Contiguous United States. The dataset spans from February 2016 to December 2019 and is organized into 47 feature-rich columns, capturing detailed information about accident severity, location, weather conditions, time of day, and more.

The data was thoroughly explored and analyzed using Python-Jupyter Notebook (Numpy, Pandas, and powerful data visualization tools: including Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly) to generate insightful visualizations such as scatter plots, bar graphs, and geospatial heatmaps. These visualizations were instrumental in uncovering patterns and trends related to accident frequency, geographical hotspots, and correlations with external factors like weather and time.
